Vicki,2021-08-03,"Clorox Disinfecting Wipes,(225 Count Pack)",1.0,"The box this item was delivered in was wet!! When I opened the box my order was leaking wet liquid. My church is collecting needed supplies for a local public school and this order was something that was requested to donate to the school. But I cannot donate this item that included (3) containers of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes because of the leakage and not sealed properly. The containers are wet and the labels on the containers are peeling off because they are wet from the leakage,which makes them look like they were opened and used. This is very disappointing but it appears that they were packaged good and tight and should not have leaked. I dont know how the leakage could have been prevented but I ask you to investigate to see if it could be fixed and so it could be prevented possibly for the future customers. Thanks so much for investigating and correcting if possible!

We use these in every part of our home. Door knobs, the bathroom, the kitchen and even wiping down the kids toys. Leaves everything clean and smelling nice. The lemon scent is my absolute favorite. Makes the whole area smell like you've spent a hours cleaning. Works great on the stove too. Easily breaks down and wipes up grease and other touch splatters and spills like tomato sauce. We've really counted on these the last two years to keep us safe and I am happy to report we have stayed safe and haven't been sick the entire two years. For that, I am very thankful to Clorox.

TRP,2021-04-10,Refreshing and trustworthy,5.0,"Name brand that has been known in the cleaning industry for years. These wipes are a good size, and come out of the container without rubbing or tearing on a rough plastic like the less expensive brands. They are easily torn apart on taking out of the container, where as some other brands many cloths are wasted because 3-5 come out at once. There is a nice, refreshing scent without being too harsh and abrasive. Also, the individual cloths are moist so you know you are getting some cleaner with them. Most other brands come out dry. I've even had to pour more cleaner in half used containers of other brands directly over the cloths because they were dried out. Waste of money. During this time of Covid we have depended on these and had a container in almost every room, as well as the car. We simply trust them. And, will continue to have available in our home long after we get back to ""normal"".

The box was wet on one side and I could smell the strong contents of the Clorox disinfecting wipes coming from the inside! I had not opened the box at that point but the smell was so strong so you can imagine once I did open the contents! Paper was inserted into the box but there was no other type of wrapping other than what the item came with. The contents was soaked and two of the containers lids were slightly opened! Liquid was all over, it was a huge mess!! Needless to say I will not be ordering this item from Walmart in the future! With COVID-19 in effect and being handicapped I thought ordering any product would be safe not to mention convenient, but little did I know I was wrong!! I have ordered laundry soap liquid as well as other types of liquids and have not experienced this issue! Not happy with this at all. Im hoping that when I do use the item there will be liquid left inside that keeps the wipes moist!

Stephanie,2021-04-06,,1.0,The inside of the box was wet. The labels on the clorox containers are coming off from being wet. The wipes seem to still be wet but I'm afraid they may not be as effective if the wetness is from the wiped themselves.
